# Birth_Cohort-

This repository host developed simulations of a birth cohort, to explore the interaction of incidence, prevalence and excess mortality, including the ability to generate simulated survey data. The simulated data was analysed using an adaptation of Mahiane et al. (2012)‘s estimator. Sensitivity analysis can be conducted in order to explore optimal study designs. We demonstrate the application of this suite of analytical tools by investigating optimal time intervals between successive cross sectional surveys, conducted for estimating incidence in the time between the surveys, for a specific epidemiological scenario. We also considered an alternative design consisting of a single cross sectional survey, including testing for ‘recent infection’, performed at the midpoint of the two surveys considered in the first design(The work is being compiled into a publication).

The platform (suite of functions) are used to carry out further analysis and the quantification of errors associated with the estimator of interest.  This work is part of my work and a large project, entailing its use by colleagues, which will eventually lead to building a package or library for public distribution.
